- [x] add caching support to make it so we don't have to recompile some code
- [x] add -c compile flag for clearing
- [?] add multthreading for the compilation step
- [:)] fix code :)
- [ ] add config option to switch caching algorithm
  - [ ] add other hashing algorithms
- [ ] add some way to check what the previous config flags were, and recompile the files if that's the case (i.e. if you compile -g, then compile with -r, it should recompile all of the files)
- [ ] update config layout to allow pre_exec and post_exec to include lua functions, so that we can allow lua code to be run instead of just shell commands
- [ ] update config layout to remove the requirement that config.flags always start with '-'
- [ ] odd bug that occurs if you change something and it results in the same hash code meaning hat the program doesn't recompile (no idea how to fix this)
- [ ] issue where we're writing the cache to the file even if there's a compilation failure, so we should fix that some how :)
- [ ] need to make it so that if there is a compilation error with one of the previous compilations that the post_exec commands and such are not run
